Feed the raccoons
~t 0
You hear rustling in the tall grass by the entrance to your dormitory.
You glance over and see a raccoon slink out of its cover.
It approaches you cautiously, but with expectance.
In your pocket are two cookies, your late-night snack.

1 Give a cookie to the raccoon|You didn't need two cookies anyway.
3 Flee!|You enter the building and shut the door.

The raccoon gleefully accepts your cookie and munches on it.
You smile and take a picture, but after you put your phone away, you notice that the raccoon has already finished.
It moves a little closer to you.

The raccoon accepts your cookie, but this time, does not consume it immediately.
Instead, it salutes you and returns back to the grasses.
What a story you'll have for your friends.
