Your phone has been going off nonstop for the last few minutes.

"Mass meeting in an hour! Free food + fun!"

"I was thinking of trying the pizza place down the street tonight"
"Yeah looked interesting to me too"
"Oh I had been meaning to go there, anyone else interested?"

"Good luck on our exam tomorrow! Don't forget to get some good sleep tonight. -Prof."

So many options, so little time. What do you do?

a member, and decide to join. You also meet some other people with similar interests. They might become good friends.
However, as the meeting winds down, you notice that it's getting a little late.
