You prepare for a long study session. An upcoming exam for a required {major} class has you a little worried, but
you're confident some solid practice and review will make it easy.
*Bzzt!* Just before putting it away, your phone alerts you to a new message.
"We're going out tonight. You coming? Should be great."

It sounds like it might be fun, but you have too much work to get done tonight. After a good session, you're confident
in your ability to pass the exam. You do wonder what it would've been like if you'd gone....

It sounds too good not to be there. You know you'll enjoy the night, but worry about finding time to study later....
