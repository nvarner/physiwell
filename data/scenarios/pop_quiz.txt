"Put all your technology away, and take out a pen our pencil. We're having a pop quiz." he announces.
The collective moans of horror and dismay made your professor's two days worth it.
Your heart misses beat, but luckily...

"Good luck," you whisper to the class brain.
"I must express my regret to inform you, that to 'wish one good luck' has no scientific basis to demonstrate a supernatural change to the destiny predetermined by present factors. Nevertheless, I sincerely hope that you are prepared for this assessment, so that you may perform well," the brain says.
You nod, for you have prepared very well. The answers are sitting right next to you.
