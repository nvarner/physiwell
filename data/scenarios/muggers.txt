Mugger Encounter
~t 0
You stumble through the dead of night.
As you walk back to your residence, you make a mental note to never stay so late again.
Silent, dark, and empty, the streets are void of life.
It has never been so quiet. Calming, peaceful, the world is asleep.
No crowding students, no honking cars, no traffic, no rush.

As you wander the campus, you are impressed by how different it is at night.
"Great night, kid."
You agree.
"Don't turn around."
You instinctively turn around, and face a man in a hoodie, his hands in his pockets.
"Hand over your bag," he says.

You perform a few calming routines.

It was worth a try.

You run back to your dorm at full sprint.
The man chases after you.
Luckily, you had a head start, and you're near enough to your dormitory that the man gives up and runs away.
But just in case, you sprint the way.

He backs up, surprised.
You try to put up a combat stance based upon all the movies you've watched.
He seems to decide it isn't worth it and runs away. 
You're not sure if you could have beat him if he fought back, but you're glad he didn't.

It's over... slowly you regain your senses and calm yourself.
You rush back to your dormitory and report what happened.
Hopefully they'll be able to help.
