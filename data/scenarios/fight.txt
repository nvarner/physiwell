They lower their fists a little, temporarily.
"This person thinks that the Earth is flat on the back of a tortoise. Can you believe that?" the blue-shirted one on the left says.
"I don't what to say, but they think that birds work for the government as mercenary spies," says the red-shirted one on the right.
You chuckle to yourself.
"Tell'em I'm right!" says the blue-shirt.
"Tell'em they're wrong!" says the red-shirt.
"Oh, it'll be you!" says the blue-shirt.
"If you're wrong, I'm the only one left!" says the red-shirt.

"Oh, is that so!" the blue-shirt says, raising their fists.

With a scream of rage, someone throws a punch.
Before long, they are wrestling on the ground, a mess of blood and torn clothes.
The spectators call for help, and the fight is broken by campus security.
