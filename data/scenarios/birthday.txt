You're pretty sure her birthday passed already, quite recently in fact, based on your text history with her.
But you assume she knows her birthday better than you do.

"ehhh ok, in an hour" Phoebe says.
You meet with them at the campus park for a nice walk.
It's a beautiful day, and even your friend's seem to have enjoyed the walk.
"We're going to Drew's after to play some cards, you coming?" Phoebe suddenly asks.

You rush to the gym and perform your workout a little quicker than you normally would.
You manage to complete your reps in record time, but you do the full duration on the treadmill.
A little fatigued, you rush to the game room, but find they've already left.
You text them, and wait a bit, but they don't respond.
An hour and a half later, you find out they were watching a movie at a theater, and are now going for dinner.
Unfortunately, you just ate, and are feeling tired.

It's an important day — a birthday — for your friend, after all.
You could use a break anyway, and what better way than to celebrate your friend's birthday?
You make a mental note to do your stuff later. For now, it's party time!
...
You hang out with your friends til an hour past midnight.
