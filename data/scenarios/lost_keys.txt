Lost keys
~t 0
After arriving at your dorm, you reach into your pocket to pull out your keys.
Then, you reach into another pocket.
You reach into your jacket.
You reach into your backpack.
You reach into your brain and recall maybe dropping them... somewhere. Where was it again?
Unfortunately, the desk that can replace your key is closed for the next few hours.

You go on a long run through campus. You keep your eyes peeled for your keys, but don't ever see them. When the desk
opens, you head in and get a replacement.

You meet up with your friends. After a while, you mention your keys, prompting someone to say they saw keys on the
ground earlier. You all head over and manage to recover some keys. Everyone wants to confirm that they are the right
keys, so you head to your dorm and unlock the door. Now in your room, you all pick up the conversation from before
your search.
