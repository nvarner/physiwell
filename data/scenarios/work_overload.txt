Too Much Work
~t 0
You exit your class, and stop by a bench to text your friends.
"Yeah, I'm down to watch a movie, just going to do my hw first" Dave says.
You decide that's a good idea, and check what assignments you still have to do before the next week.
Let's see...
Daily short homeworks from three classes.
Three essays.
Two project.
Two exams, one quiz.
And a couple of extra credit assignments.
All due within a week.
You try to estimate the number of hours it'll take to complete it all, but the answer seems to increase without bound.

You calm yourself, and go for a walk.
Neither the squirrels nor the trees are in a rush, so neither are you.
After the walk, the work seems a little more manageable, if you do it slowly.

Your friends are disappointed, but understanding.
While they watch the Rainbow Super Rangers defeat Illimain of the Illuminators, you are watching your fingers type at unforeseen speeds.
But you manage to finish all your work in time, and you believe you did well.

By the time that movie time rolls around, you've barely scratched the surface of the work.
Your friends enjoy the movie. You try to, but the work boggles your mind.
Your friends are glad you came, though they can tell you are troubled.
...
