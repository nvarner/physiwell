Too Much Work
~t 0
You exit your class, and stop by a bench to text your friends.
"Yeah, I'm down to watch a movie, just going to do my hw first" Dave says.
You decide that's a good idea, and check what assignments you still have to do before the next week.
Let's see...
Daily short homeworks from three classes.
Three essays.
Two project.
Two exams, one quiz.
And a couple of extra credit assignments.
All due within a week.
You try to estimate the number of hours it'll take to complete it all, but the answer seems to increase without bound.
