Today is the day of the big game, against your rival, Stalin's State University.
You feel nervous, but your captain pats you on the back.
"We've been practicing all year for this. We'll get 'em," they say.
In the locker room, your team seems even more anxious than you are.
"I heard Stalin State's been undefeated this season!" Sam says.
"The Executioners? That's a terrifying name," Charlie says.
"Have you seen them? They look like they're going to smash our bones," Taylor says.

As you wait and dread the upcoming game, your head begins to spin.
Your stomach aches, and you hunch over.
"Hey, {name}, are you all right?" your Captain says.
You nod, and reach out a hand, but they look so far away...
...
You wake on a cot, surrounded by paramedics.
"Ok, this one's awake," one says.
You ask for what happened.
"You passed out before the game," they say.
Oh no, the game!
"Don't worry, it's over," they say.
You search for your team.
They are happy to see that you are all right, but it seems they've lost.
Though they are clearly saddened, they share funny and relatable stories with you

A couple of players chuckle nervously.
"What? How's that allowed?" Charlie says.
You explain that it was just a joke, and your team breathes out sighs of relief.
"Oh, ha ha, I knew that," Charlie says.
