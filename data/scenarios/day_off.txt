You wake up. Get dressed. Brush your teeth. Eat breakfast.
Prepare for another grueling school day.
What work awaits? What new things will you learn?
What happens today?
Before you head out, you check your email in case there's somethng you're forgetting.
Surprise! No classes today!
You cheer, and check what work needs to be done for tomorrow.
None. None at all.

It's a beautiful day outside. The sun is bright, and there is a slight breeze against your face.
Several students are feeding birds, and the squirrels seem to be competing as well.
You round the lake — calm, clear, reflecting the trees opposite it — twice, three times.

While you were doing your 43rd push-up, another student expresses awe toward your endurance.
You have a nice conversation about your exercise routines.
His is a little unbalanced, consisting of too much upper-body workout, so you suggest he perform more lunges or use the Ellipticals.

You check next week, and to your dismay, a myriad of assignments have filled your online calendar.
You do your future self a favor, and start them now.

Before long, you check your calendar, and it is nowhere near as daunting as it was.

You eat some snacks, watch the squirrels, and do some window shopping.
It's good to be free.
