Feed the squirrels
~t 0
As you return to your dorm, you notice the squirrels have taken an interest to you.
Four of them gather around you. They seem to be expecting something.
You search through your bookbag, but only find your one bag of nuts and seeds.
You were planning on snacking on them after a long day of classes, but the squirrels are pleading to be fed.

You open your bag of nuts and pour a couple into your hand.
You offer it to the squirrels, and they graciously accept the gift.
As you start to pack them away, however, you notice the squirrels — 7 now? — are pleading for more.

You pour more nuts and seeds into your hand and offer them to the squirrels.
Gratefully, the adorable creatures eat out of your hand.
...
Before long, you pour the bag but only a single nut comes out.
A cute baby squirrel reaches out and takes it from your hand.
You return to your dorm a little hungry, but with a light feeling.

As you race to your dorm, the squirrels follow for a few meters before deciding to let you escape.
Before entering the building, you turn around and catch a glimpse of the squirrels glaring back, before you close the door.
Your snacks are saved.
