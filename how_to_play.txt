Welcome to Physiwell!

Physiwell is a text-based choice narrative game.

[To do: any information concerning compilation and running the game]

You are an undergraduate student, returning for a new semester at Great Minds University.
After you arrive, check-in to your dorm, and figure out all the administrative details,
you find out that you have been randomly selected by the University to test out the Physiwell Watchit.
The Physiwell Watchit is the latest fitness-tracking watch from Physiwell Inc.
It will track data on your physique and give recommendations for your fitness.
This is an optional choice; you may decline the Physiwell Watchit.
With a new semester ahead, you feel excited to see what awaits you this semester.

To play, you will be prompted throughout the game to make decisions for your avatar.
The selections you can choose from are preceded by a number.
To make a choice, simply type the number of your desired choice and then hit the enter key.

Enjoy the stories!
