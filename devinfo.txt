scenarios.txt file notes:
    Two sections: #Special Events and #Random Events


Scenarios' first line is always a title.
Only need to read through the file once
Sleep after printing each line.
~[char] denotes delimiter. Read next text differently for each delimiter
~t [int] - text: print each line. ~t will have a number after; this is for mappying choices to text blocks.
            Always read the text block if the argument is 0.
~w [int] - watchit text: same as ~t, but only print if the player has the Physiwell Watchit.

~c - choices: Number, text, text. Text are separated by the | character.
                Only print choices for which the requirements are met. Number choices printed from 1 to n.
                The number maps to later text block.
                First text is the choice description.
                Second text is the choice confirmation, printed if chosen.
~a [int] [aspect] +|-[int] - If the user ever selected the given number, increase or decrease the specified aspect by
                                the specified amount.
