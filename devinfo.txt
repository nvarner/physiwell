~t [int] - text: print each line. ~t will have a number after; this is for mappying choices to text blocks.
            Always read the text block if the argument is 0.

~w [int] - watchit text: same as ~t, but only print if the player has the Physiwell Watchit.

~c - choices: Number, text, text. Text are separated by the | character.
                Only print choices for which the requirements are met. Number choices printed from 1 to n.
                The number maps to later text block.
                First text is the choice description.
                Second text is the choice confirmation, printed if chosen.
    Keep track of all numbers from choices, and perform all commands with those numbers.

~a [int] [aspect] +|-[int] - If the user ever selected the given number, increase or decrease the specified aspect by
