Notes and Compendium

Scenarios' first line is always a title.
Only need to read through the file once
Sleep after printing each line.
~[char] denotes delimiter. Read next text differently for each delimiter
~t [int] - text: print each line. ~t will have a number after; this is for mappying choices to text blocks.
            Always read the text block if the argument is 0.
~w [int] - watchit text: same as ~t, but only print if the player has the Physiwell Watchit.
~p - prerequisites (can appear only right after title):
~c - choices: Number, text, text. Text are separated by the | character.
                Only print choices for which the requirements are met. Number choices printed from 1 to n.
                The number maps to later text block. If the number is 0, it means the next text block.
                First text is the choice description.
                Second text is the choice confirmation, printed if chosen.
